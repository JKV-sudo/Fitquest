# üî• Firebase Setup Guide for FitQuest

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- Expo CLI installed
- A Google account for Firebase

## Step 1: Create Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Add project"
3. Enter project name: `fitquest-app` (or your preferred name)
4. Disable Google Analytics (optional for now)
5. Click "Create project"

## Step 2: Configure Authentication

1. In Firebase Console, go to "Authentication"
2. Click "Get started"
3. Go to "Sign-in method" tab
4. Enable "Email/Password" provider
5. Click "Save"

## Step 3: Set up Firestore Database

1. Go to "Firestore Database" in Firebase Console
2. Click "Create database"
3. Choose "Start in test mode" (we'll secure it later)
4. Select a location closest to your users (e.g., us-central1)

## Step 4: Get Firebase Config

1. Go to Project Settings (gear icon in left sidebar)
2. Scroll down to "Your apps" section
3. Click "Add app" and select the Web app icon `</>`
4. Enter app nickname: "FitQuest React Native"
5. **Don't check** "Also set up Firebase Hosting"
6. Click "Register app"
7. Copy the entire `firebaseConfig` object

## Step 5: Add Config to Your App

Replace the placeholder config in `src/config/firebase.ts` with your actual config:

```typescript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-actual-api-key-here",
  authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789012",
  appId: "1:123456789012:web:abcdef123456789"
};
```

## Step 6: Set Firestore Security Rules

In Firestore Console, go to "Rules" tab and replace the default rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Characters can be read/written by their owner
    match /characters/{characterId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        (request.auth.uid + '_character') == characterId;
    }
    
    // Fitness data can be read/written by owner
    match /fitness_data/{docId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        docId.matches(request.auth.uid + '_.*');
    }
    
    // User quests can be read/written by owner
    match /user_quests/{questId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    // Allow read access to leaderboards
    match /characters/{characterId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

Click "Publish" to save the rules.

## Step 7: Test the Setup

1. **Start your Expo app**: `npx expo start`
2. **Create a test account**: Try signing up with a new email
3. **Check Firebase Console**: 
   - Go to Authentication ‚Üí Users (should see your new user)
   - Go to Firestore ‚Üí Data (should see users and characters collections)

## üéØ Features Now Enabled

**Error: "Permission denied"**
- Check that Firestore security rules are properly set and published
- Make sure user is signed in when accessing data

**Error: "Network request failed"**
- Ensure device has internet connection
- Check Firebase project is active in console

**Error: "Invalid API key"**
- Double-check the API key in your config
- Make sure the Firebase project is active
