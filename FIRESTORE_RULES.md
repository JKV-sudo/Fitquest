# üî• **URGENT**: Update Your Firestore Security Rules

## The Problem
Your Firestore database is using the default rules that block all reads and writes. This is why you're getting connection errors.

## The Solution

1. **Go to Firebase Console** ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí **Firestore Database**
2. **Click on "Rules" tab**
3. **Replace the default rules** with these:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow all reads and writes for now (testing only)
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Click "Publish"**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This is for testing only!

These rules allow anyone to read/write your database. After testing, replace with secure rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Characters can be read/written by their owner
    match /characters/{characterId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        (request.auth.uid + '_character') == characterId;
    }
    
    // Fitness data can be read/written by owner
    match /fitness_data/{docId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        docId.matches(request.auth.uid + '_.*');
    }
    
    // User quests can be read/written by owner
    match /user_quests/{questId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    // Allow read access to leaderboards for authenticated users
    match /characters/{characterId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## üß™ **Test Steps**

1. Update the rules (above)
2. Restart your Expo app: Press `r` in terminal
3. Try creating an account
4. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Users
5. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Data

You should see your user and character data appear!
